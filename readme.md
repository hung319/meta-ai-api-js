# Meta AI API (JavaScript)

This is an unofficial JavaScript client for interacting with Meta's AI, powered by Llama 3. It allows you to send prompts and receive responses, either as a complete object or as a real-time stream.

## Acknowledgements

This project is a JavaScript port of the original Python-based [meta-ai-api by Strvm](https://github.com/Strvm/meta-ai-api). A huge thank you to Strvm for the original reverse-engineering work and for making the initial project open source.

## Features

-   **Llama 4 Power**: Interact with the powerful Llama 3 model.
-   **Real-time Information**: Get up-to-date responses, as the AI is connected to the internet (via Bing).
-   **Streaming Support**: Process the AI's response as it's being generated.
-   **Conversation Context**: Automatically manages conversation history for follow-up questions.
-   **Source & Media Retrieval**: Get the web sources for the AI's information and links to generated media.
-   **Anonymous & Authenticated Modes**: Use the API without an account or authenticate with Facebook credentials for personalized responses and image generation.
